  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \section{Profiling}
  \frametitle{Profiling Using MAC Addresses}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item MAC addresses allow the creation of detailed user profiles by correlating data such as connection times, locations, and usage patterns. \pause
    \item This information can reveal personal habits, routines, and preferences. \pause
    \item Companies use this data for targeted advertising, while malicious actors may exploit it for social engineering attacks. \pause

\begin{frame}
  \section{How to Anonymize a MAC Address?}
  \frametitle{Anonymizing a MAC Address}

    \item \textbf{Truncation} \pause
    \item \textbf{Hashing} \pause
    \item \textbf{Encryption} 
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \section{Truncation}
  \frametitle{Truncation}
  Truncation involves shortening the MAC address by keeping only part of it, such as the first 6 octets (manufacturer's identifier), or a random portion.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Advantages:} \pause
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Simple to implement. \pause
        \item Reduces the risk of re-identification as the remaining portion doesn't contain enough identifying information. \pause
      \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Disadvantages:} \pause
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Loss of information if finer identification is needed. \pause
        \item May not be sufficient for higher anonymity as the remaining address part may still enable tracing. 
      \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \section{Hashing}
  \frametitle{Hashing}
  Hashing applies a mathematical function to the MAC address, producing a fixed-size output (hash). The process is irreversible.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Advantages:} \pause
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Irreversible, meaning the original MAC address cannot be recovered. \pause
        \item Protection against rainbow table attacks with the use of salt. \pause
        \item Easy to implement when access to the original MAC address is not needed post-anonymization. \pause
      \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Disadvantages:} \pause
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Loss of the original MAC address, which may be problematic if recovery is required for auditing or re-identification. \pause
      \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
  \textbf{Salt:} A random value added to the MAC address before hashing to enhance security, preventing attackers from using precomputed hashes.

\begin{frame}
  \section{Privacy Violation}
  \frametitle{Privacy Violation: Nordstrom}
  Nordstrom implemented technology to track customer movements in its stores through their Wi-Fi connections. The goal was to enhance the customer experience and optimize operations, such as adjusting staffing levels and rethinking department layouts. Sensors in stores collected information on the time customers spent in departments. However, after testing the technology, Nordstrom discontinued it in 2013 due to customer feedback, even though the data was intended to be anonymous and aggregated.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Impact:} Although the technology aimed to be anonymous, it raised privacy concerns regarding the collection of customer movements. \pause
    \item \textbf{Outcome:} Nordstrom decided to halt the use of the technology following the trial. 
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \section{Google Street View}
  \frametitle{Google Street View: Data Collection}
  Since 2007, Google's Street View cars inadvertently collected data from open Wi-Fi networks while photographing streets. This raised concerns about the security of personal data transmitted over these networks. In an audit, Germany's data protection authority found that Google had gathered fragments of personal web activity. Although the data was never used in products, it highlighted vulnerabilities in unsecured Wi-Fi networks.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Impact:} Google admitted to collecting personal data unintentionally. \pause
    \item \textbf{Outcome:} Google halted the data collection and plans to delete the data under third-party supervision. 
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \section{Phones with Wi-Fi On}
  \frametitle{Phones with Wi-Fi On: Renew London Project}
  In the Renew London project, data was collected from over 530,000 unique devices to analyze movement patterns, directions, and speeds. The collected data was aggregated and anonymized, but it raised concerns about privacy violations under the Data Protection Act, as MAC addresses could be considered personal data.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Impact:} The project demonstrated the potential for targeted advertising based on location and behavior. \pause
    \item \textbf{Outcome:} It is still unclear whether this data collection violated privacy laws, as the devices were not tracked individually. 
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \section{WhatsApp Security Vulnerability}
  \frametitle{WhatsApp Security Vulnerability}
  In 2012, a vulnerability in WhatsApp allowed attackers to impersonate users by obtaining their MAC address. The app relied on the MAC address for authentication, and attackers could exploit this by acquiring the MAC address via public Wi-Fi networks or malicious apps. Once in possession of the MAC address, attackers could log into WhatsApp as the victim and send messages.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Impact:} The use of static identifiers like MAC addresses for authentication posed significant security risks. \pause
    \item \textbf{Outcome:} WhatsApp strengthened its security by implementing end-to-end encryption and ceasing to use MAC addresses for user authentication. 
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}





\begin{frame}
  \section{Conclusion}
  \frametitle{Conclusion}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item MAC addresses are vital for device identification, but their use poses significant privacy risks. \pause
    \item Legal frameworks such as the GDPR and European Convention on Human Rights aim to protect individuals from misuse of their data. \pause
    \item Various anonymization techniques, like truncation, hashing, and encryption, offer ways to mitigate these risks. \pause
    \item Ensuring the security and privacy of data requires both effective technical measures and adherence to legal standards to safeguard users' rights.
